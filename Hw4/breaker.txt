Part II
------------------
Our ADT is not as well protected as we would like.  There are several ways by
which a hostile (or stupid) application can corrupt our DList (i.e., make it
violate an invariant) through method calls alone.  Describe one in a text file
named GRADER (which will be submitted with your code).  Assume that the
application is NOT in the list package (which would be a remarkably
inappropriate place to put an application).


If we call the methods like insertAfter(), remove(), etc, but pass a DListNode that is in another DList, we will violet the szie invariant. 

Ex:

DList lst1 = new DList();
lst1.insertFront(5);

DList lst2 = new DList();
lst2.remove(lst1.front());
